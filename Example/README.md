# Examples

This folder contains several circuit designs that you can refer to.
Load the .json files into the addon and the cooresponding circuits can be generated.

* NOTE: all the file names in the .json files are WRONG !!! \
Replace "Val_Library/" with the absolute path to that folder. \
Something like: "/Users/$USER_NAME/Library/Application Support/Blender/3.2/scripts/addons/fluid_circuit_generator/Val_Library"
