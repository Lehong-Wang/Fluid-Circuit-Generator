Potential Error:
  Can't update in the middle of making pipes
  can only update everything from bottom up at the end

  Need to hard reset everything if make changes to pipes and redo everything

Potential Solution:
  1. solve in UI
  2. keep track of the top level connections in gate_assembly



Potential Error:
  doesn't support float unit_dimention
  only integer


Potential Error:
  don't support resizeing gate to default size
  make sure info in json is correct


TODO:
  add free in/out put port
  also consider them when addjusting grid

  DONE


Potential Error:
  don't make port too close to ground, will product error/crapy module at bend


Potential Error:
  better keep gate ports at same level (z)
  might cause collision of pipe and module


Potential TODO:
  costom tip with module


Existing Error:
  trim-crossover not working properly
  some 0.4 discance are left over
  not sure why, already checked trim function




Existing Error:
  problem when ports are too close together
  snap to grid not recognize each other
  zig-zag pipe when snap to grid (maybe merge together)
    Fix when making fillet in pipe system

  one port have two snap
